# üìä SeqVisLego:  A Modular Construction Analytics Framework for Understanding Event Sequences

**SeqVisLego** is an interactive system for visual analysis of event sequences. It includes both a **server-side** and a **client-side** component and is designed to be run locally with Python and Node.js environments.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Make sure the following are installed:

- **Python 3.x** (‚ö†Ô∏è Python 2 is *not* supported)
- **Flask**
- **Node.js & npm**
- A modern browser  
  ‚úÖ Recommended: **Chrome** or **Edge**

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `main` branch ‚Üí contains **front-end** code (`front` directory)
- `backend` branch ‚Üí contains **back-end** code (`back` directory)

## üõ†Ô∏è Running SeqVisLego on Windows

Follow the steps below to launch the application:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone front-end code from the main branch
git clone -b main <repo-url> front

# Clone back-end code from the backend branch
git clone -b backend <repo-url> back

### 2. Start the Back-End

```bash
cd back                      # Go to the back-end folder
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install Python dependencies
python app.py                # Run the Flask server

### 3. Start the Back-End Server

```bash
cd front     # Go to the front-end folder
npm install  # Install Node.js dependencies
npm run dev  # Run the development server

### 4. Access the Application

```bash
After starting both servers, open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:5173/
You should now see the SeqVisLego interface running locally.
